# Reuters News Classification Using Keras
As a result of IBM's Applied AI with DeepLearning course assignment, news classification is done using Keras.

Reuters newswire dataset consists of 11,228 newswires from the Reuters news agency. Each wire is encoded as a sequence of word indexes, just as in the IMDB data we encountered in lecture 5 of this series. Moreover, each wire is categorised into one of 46 topics, which will serve as our label. This dataset is available through the Keras API.
